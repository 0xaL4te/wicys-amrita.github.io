Digital technologies: tensions in privacy and data : <br/>
<br/>
The digital game involves a trade-off between convenience and privacy. People often willingly share personal information online in exchange for free services, but they may not fully understand the consequences of this data sharing. The tension arises when individuals feel that their privacy has been invaded or their data misused. It is related to the tagline Understanding the game behind the Internet use.

<h2> CyberMUN</h2><br/>

MUN is a simulation of the United Nations (UN) that aims to
educate the participants about civics, effective communication,
globalization and multilateral diplomacy.
In MUN, students participate as “delegates” from the UN Member States
and simulate UN committees. From this experience, not only do they
become involved and debate about pressing current issues, but also
broaden their perspectives and their knowledge of international relations
and the UN, allowing delegates to develop their critical thinking and
reasoning skills
