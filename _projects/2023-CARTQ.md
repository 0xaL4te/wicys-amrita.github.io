Cyber Clinic is an assessment based on Incident Response Simulation to understand the Cyber Readiness of the Participants who takes the examination which will include various degrees of Awareness, Attack Scenarios, and Reaction Challenges to analyze their Cyber Quotient (CQ). 

We are following our custom-created ART approach (Awareness, Recognize, Treatment) where each level requires an increasing level of awareness and knowledge to proceed to the next level thereby estimating their CQ.

Based on the obtained CQ, the advisory panel will recommend the General and Participant-Specific Cyber Readiness Guidelines and Tips.
