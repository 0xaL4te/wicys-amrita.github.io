**Take Away**

Remember this word '**AMMA**':

**A - Awareness** : be aware of the technologies we are using, information we are sharing, and who all can access it <br/>
**M - Mindful Sharing** : whatever we share is there on the internet forever, once you click a link your money is gone, think before you share <br/>
**M - Mindful Decisions being Non-Judgemental** : if we don't judge our children they will come to us to share their problems <br/>
**A - Anonymity** : a lot of problems in the world is because of anonymity and we should teach them that nothing is anonymous <br/>
